We just published our local git repoto remote Github.com repositery
Few things happened:
1: It automatically created new Remote repository under our Github.com account
2:Made the connection with your local git repo
3:Added all your commits to remote repo


  Now our work will continue locally

  1. add a new file called note.txt
  2. Commited the change to local repo
  3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commits remote repository using push origin button
  4.Observe it has been added in your repository under Github.com
